A mobile application that aims to help laptop users who want to repair their laptops by booking laptop service without the need to go to a laptop service place. Lappies developed an application that provides a practical solution for users who want to repair their laptops without the hassle of visiting a service centre. The app also provides added value to laptop shop partners by helping them manage orders. To achieve these goals, the project required analysing the business process by creating a system design diagram. By doing this, Lappies managed to design a system that suits the user's needs and is fit for purpose.
